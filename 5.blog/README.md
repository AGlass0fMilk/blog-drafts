# Blog

This is the final stop for your posts—the folder where drafts become published entries. Once you’re satisfied with a post (or at least happy enough within your self-imposed deadline), move it here to prep for publishing.

The folder is simply named `blog`, rather than `5-blog`, so that links between posts work both in draft mode and on the live site. In your published blog, all posts live under the `/blog/` path, and this setup keeps things consistent.

When you move a file here, remember to add the publish date and time to the filename. For example, a draft named `workflow-for-jekyll.md` might become `201606131900-workflow-for-jekyll.md` when it’s ready to go live.
