# Outlining

This folder is where you start shaping your ideas into something more structured. As your thoughts develop, begin adding headers to your Markdown files. These headers serve as the main points you might want to cover in your post.

Outlining helps you assess whether your idea is best suited to a single post or if it naturally branches into several. It also gets you thinking early about what you're really trying to say—and what the key components of that message are.

Don't worry about getting it perfect. You might find yourself adjusting headers later to match how the content actually unfolds. That’s all part of the process.
