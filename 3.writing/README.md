# Writing

This folder is where your post ideas really come to life. By the time you've created headers, you've already been thinking deeply about what you want to say—and you're probably excited to dive in.

You might even find that, in your enthusiasm, you've already dropped some draft paragraphs or scattered notes between the headers. That’s a good sign! Once you're actively writing, it’s time to move your file from the outlining stage into this folder.

Try not to let editing slow you down here. Focus on getting your thoughts and feelings out in full. A solid first draft gives you something real to refine later.
