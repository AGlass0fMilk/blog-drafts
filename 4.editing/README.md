# Editing

This folder is for refining your drafts. Once you’ve finished a first draft, move the file here and give it a little breathing room. Letting it sit allows you to return with fresh eyes and a sharper sense of what works—and what doesn’t.

Ideally, you’ll come back to these drafts when you’re in an editing mood and have enough distance from the original writing session. That space can make your edits more focused and productive.

It’s tempting to edit as you write, and sometimes it happens. But separating writing and editing helps keep your creative flow uninterrupted. This folder reinforces that habit in your workflow.
