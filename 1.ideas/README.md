# Post Ideas

This folder is where you drop your post ideas. Whenever inspiration strikes, just create a new Markdown fileâ€”even if it's empty at first. The filename alone can be enough to remind you what you wanted to explore.

Some ideas may stay as stubs, and that's okay. As thoughts develop, you can gradually flesh them out, shape their structure, and turn them into full blog posts when you're ready.

Think of this space as your idea incubator.
